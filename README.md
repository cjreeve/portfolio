Here shall upload some examples of my programming experience

**sfaplot.C**

I wrote this analysis code for my PhD research. It contains a number of functions for loading and performing analysing on particle physics data. The headers are imported from the ROOT analysis tool kit. 

I have a litte object-oriented C++ experience from updates I performed on monte-calo simulations. However, identifying which parts are my own code would now be a challenge. The above work is all my own.

I recently worked on a command-line memory training program, but I'm not sure if I am ready to share it with the world!
