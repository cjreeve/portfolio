Here shall upload some examples of my programming experience

**sfaplot.C**

I wrote this analysis code for my PhD research. It contains a number of functions for loading and performing analysing on particle physics data. The headers are imported from the ROOT analysis tool kit. 

I have a little object-oriented C++ experience from updates I performed on Monte-Carlo simulations. However, identifying which parts are my own code would now be a challenge. The above work is all my own.

I recently worked on a command-line memory training program, but I'm not sure if I am ready to share it with the world!

**my_thesis.pdf**

Here is a copy of my thesis, which demonstrates the kind of analysis that I was doing and the the attention to detail that I put towards the presentation of the results.

The analysis techniques, which is on random radioactive count data, might be of use for analysing website hits.
